## Hi, I'm Noah

I’m a cloud engineer based in Los Angeles, California, with a focus on enterprise-level systems and a deep passion for cloud architecture. My primary expertise is in AWS, but I also enjoy architecting smaller-scale solutions using VPS services and open-source tools.

When my head isn’t in the clouds, I still bring the “infrastructure as code” mentality home with me. I’m particularly drawn to using Infrastructure as Code tools, like NixOS, for self hosting and development tooling.

I also created Ekiree Technology, a cloud consulting company focused on helping colleges and small businesses build out cloud solutions. Ekiree collaborates with Whittier College to develop the Ekiree Dashboard, an open-source educational platform that serves over 2,000 users with a scalable cloud-based backend. And, to mentor Whittier Students, so that they can pursue careers in Cloud Technology.

Currently, I’m diving deeper into Kubernetes and its ecosystem, with plans to use it to rebuild my home lab. I look forward to sharing my configuration files once the project is complete.

Outside of cloud tech, I enjoy powerlifting, building custom computers, and collecting mechanical watches—hobbies that let me blend my technical mindset with a love for craftsmanship and precision.
